Any executable file found in this subdirectory tree will be run at the beginning
and in-between every subtest.  The default configuration variables will be made
available as environment variables for reference.  All executables should exit
non-zero if they detect a problem, optionally printing helpful messages indicating
why.  Checks may be bypassed by including their relative pathname in the CSV list
of option 'envcheck_skip' in defaults.ini
